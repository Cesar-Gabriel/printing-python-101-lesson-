# keep in mind that gray or green is that the command is NULL but put # as a note 

# printing is the mos basic thing in python, to print (not in the printer, in the terminal) use print command, no UpPeRcAsE letters

# use print ("Hello, world!") to print it (remember to have VScode), here, have a print already. i already put the print now on the "" put "Hello, world!"

print ("")

# an "," can separate text, and a "+" joins text

print ("hello,",  "world!")
print ("hello," + "world!")
# leave with no "+" or "," to do less work, but remember to close with "" if you're not on VScode

print ("hello, world!")

# if says "syntax error" is beacuse you forgot a "()" or the "".)

# to test run it on VScode and download the python extension, i recoment using a .py file, after that press that triangle, that means run code.

# Thats the lesson of today
